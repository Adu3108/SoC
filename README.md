#  SoC - Tools for Data Science
### Team : Advait Padhye & Sameep Chattopadhyay
### Mentor: Dev Moxaj Desai
## Work Plan
1. **Week 1 : Numpy & Pandas**
2. **Week 2 : Regression & task 1 (Linear Regression)**
3. **Week 3 : Clustering & Task 2 ( KNN)** 
4. **Week 4 : Neural Networks & Task 3 (PCA)** 
5.  **Week 5 : Final Project**

All the reading materials provided by our mentor pertaining to the SoC work has been added in the *Reading Materials* folder and all the three assignments (tasks) have been added in their own respective folders.
Our Final Project was to make a *Movie Recommendation System* and that has been added to the Projects folder of this Repository.
The movie recommendation system makes use of the KNN algoritm and we have used an open source database named *movielens-small* for this purpose.

We are thankful to our mentor & the MnP club for providing us with an opportunity to do this SoC project.
